# t-tests and regressions 

Here's the claim:

> - The same p-value for the test. 

Let's go! 

```{r make data for t-test and regression}
d <- data.frame(
  id = 1:100) %>% 
  mutate(
    x = sample(c('a', 'b'), size = 100, replace = TRUE), 
    y = 10 + .2 * (x == 'a') + rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
  )
```

```{r check that it does what we want}
d %>% 
  group_by(x) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_y = mean(y)
  ) # this checks out! 
```
